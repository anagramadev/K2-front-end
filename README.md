## Usage

Use the files in `./src` to implement changes regarding javascript (or css).

The files will be compiled and placed in the public folder. Make sure to run a production build before pushing, since the files compiled during dev are not made for production.

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start a dev server on port 8081 and watch the css + js files run:

```bash
npm run start
```

If you don't want to have a dev web server and only watch the css + js files run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can use and copy the `test.html` file as boilerplate for new pages.


### Production

Before publishing the project to netlify run:

```bash
npm run build
```

to create a production build and to inspect the build you can run:

```bash
npm run serve
```
